    <h2 id="art1">Sunset Dreams</h2>
    <img src="img1.png" 
         alt="Water Colour" width="400" height="300">
    <p>Watercolor is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended <br> in a water-soluble vehicle. The traditional and most common support for watercolor paintings <br>is paper; other supports include papyrus, bark papers, plastics, vellum or leather, fabric,<br> wood and canvas. In East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to <br> as brush painting or scroll painting. In Chinese, Korean, and Japanese painting it has been <br>the dominant medium, often in monochrome black or browns. India, Ethiopia and other countries <br> also have long traditions. Finger-painting with watercolor paints originated in China.</p>

    <h2 id="art2">Flower</h2>
    <img src="image2.png" 
         alt="Abstract digital waves" width="400" height="300">
    <p>Color, made up of hue, saturation, and value, dispersed over a surface is the essence of <br>painting, just as pitch and rhythm are the essence of music. Color is highly subjective, but has <br> observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next.<br> Black is associated with mourning in the West, but in the East, white is. Some painters,<br> theoreticians, writers, and scientists, including Goethe,[16] Kandinsky,[17] and Newton,<br>[18] have written their own color theory.</p>

    <h2 id="art3">Mountain Glow</h2>
    <img src="img3.png" 
         alt="Mountain landscape painting" width="400" height="300">
    <p>Gouache is a water-based paint consisting of pigment and other materials designed to be used<br> in an opaque painting method. Gouache differs from watercolor in that the particles are <br>larger, the ratio of pigment to water is much higher, and an additional, inert, white pigment such<br> as chalk is also present. This makes gouache heavier and more opaque, with greater reflective<br> qualities. Like all water media, it is diluted with water.[38] Gouache was a popular paint utilized<br> by Egyptians,[39] Painters such as Francois Boucher used this medium. <br>This paint is best applied with sable brushes</p>

    <img src="img4.png" 
         alt="City lights at night" width="400" height="300">
    <p>Satellite images (also Earth observation imagery, spaceborne photography, or simply <br>satellite photo) are images of Earth collected by imaging satellites operated by governments and<br> businesses around the world. Satellite imaging companies sell images by licensing them to governments and <br>businesses such as Apple Maps and Google Maps.</p>

    <h2 id="art5">Modern art</h2>
    <img src="image.png" 
         alt="Vintage black and white photograph" width="400" height="300">
    <p>Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s<br> to the 1970s, and denotes the styles and philosophies of the art produced during that era.<br>[1] The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in <br>a spirit of experimentation.[2] Modern artists experimented with <br>new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials<br> and functions of art.</p>
